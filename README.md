# Code Clash 1 ("fanmade" lab)
This is a made-up lab that hopefully/inshaAllah works better than the code clashes that are on an online IDE.

It uses a CTF format to ensure that those who finish first actually finish first, with flags to make sure that they have completed the CC challenge.

This challenge is to average 10 numbers.
